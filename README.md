# chatbot_tom
Tom is a chatbot, which provides you with information about the water park Elypso in Deggendorf.
Attention: Tom speaks only german.

This was a Javascript project for the course "Internet technologies" for my studies in 2021.

Run the staticExpression.json file. Than open the chatbot in your browser as localhoser (localhost:8081).
